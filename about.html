<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi! I'm a final-year student at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, currently pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. My academic interests lie deeply in the world of semiconductors—their behaviors, properties, and how they power modern technology. I'm also highly intrigued by communication systems and the fascinating mechanics behind data transfer through various channels.

<p>
Beyond the core curriculum, I'm an enthusiastic learner in the fields of competitive programming and algorithmic problem-solving. I enjoy tackling challenging problems that sharpen my logical thinking and push the boundaries of what I can do with code.
</p>

<p>
Outside of academics, I have a strong passion for athletics, particularly long-distance running. It teaches me discipline, consistency, and mental endurance—values I carry into every aspect of life. I also enjoy reading self-help books and exploring spiritual ideas, which help me stay grounded and reflective.
</p>

<p>
I thrive in team environments, and I believe that great ideas come to life when people collaborate with purpose and passion. Whether it’s a tech project, a programming contest, or a group run, I’m always excited to contribute, learn, and grow with others.
